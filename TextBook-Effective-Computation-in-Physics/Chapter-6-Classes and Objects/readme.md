# Chapter 6: Classes and Objects

## Object Orientation as the Computational Framework for Scientific Computation

Object Orientation - Representation of entities as classes of objects having attributes, behaviours and hierarchical relationships

Classes - Organize data, methods and functions.

## Object Orientation

 A framework for classifying distinct concepts into comprehensible and digetible chunks.
 
 A framework for organization data, methods and functions peculiar to an entity, a model, an object
 
 Object Orientation is defined by the following properties - 
 
 1. **Encapsulation** - The property of owning data
 2. **Inheritance** - The property of relationship hierarchy between classes
 3. **Polymorphism** - The property of implementaion or adaptation - classes can cutomize their own behaviour even when they are based on other classes

## Objects

- Have attributes and methods
- __.....___ : known as attributes. Present in user controlled namespaces.
- __ means **dunder** - **d**ouble **under**score

# MY UNDERSTANDING

## The Fundamentals of Object Orientation

1. Representation - A model of a particular thing
2. Description - Describing the model based on the properties of the thing
3. Organization - Arrangement of the properties of the thing in something like a container - which is the class
4. Accessibility - Accessing a particular property of the model from the container
5. Implementation and Adaptation - Creating an interactable object - which is an instance of the class. Creating an object is like the only way to use the model that has been created
6. Transferability and Inheritance - Being related by propert(y)/(ies). The model (intinial representation of a thing - the parent model) should be able to transfer all or some of its properties to a daughter model and the daughter model should be able to accept it and also create something of its own, so that it is not exactly like the parent.
7. Interaction - The communication of properties within the model
8. Reaction - The response of the interactable object to a property of the model. For a example - create an object and call a method on it, the object reacts accordingly to the method called on it.
9.  Ownership - Property of the model. What makes this model this model. For example, why are you, YOU ? These properties can be - 
10.  Data - Property of model
11.  Methods - Property of the model
12.  Functions - Property of the model

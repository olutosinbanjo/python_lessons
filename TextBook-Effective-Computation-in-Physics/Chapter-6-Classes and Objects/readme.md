# Chapter 6: Classes and Objects

## The Fundamentals of Object Orientation

1. Representation - A model of a particular thing
2. Description - Describing the model based on the properties of the thing
3. Organization - Arrangement of the properties of the thing in something like a container - which is the class
4. Accessibility - Accessing a particular property of the model from the container
5. Implementation and Adaptation - Creating an interactable object (which could be parent or daughter). Creating an object is like the only way to use the model that has been created
6. Transferability and Inheritance - The parent model should be able to transfer all or some of its properties to a daughter model and the daughter model should be able to accept it and also create something of its own, so that it is not exactly like the parent.
7. Interaction - The communication of properties within the model
8.  Ownership - Property of the model. What makes this model this model. For example, why are you, YOU ? These properties can be - 
9.  Data - Property of model
10.  Methods - Property of the model
11.  Functions - Property of the model

## Object Orientation as the Computational Framework for Scientific Computation

Object Orientation - Representation of entities as classes of objects having attributes, behaviours and hierarchical relationships

Classes - Organize data, methods and functions.

## Object Orientation

 A framework for classifying distinct concepts into comprehensible and digetible chunks.
 
 A framework for organization data, methods and functions peculiar to an entity, a model, an object
 
 Object Orientation is defined by the following properties - 
 
 1. **Encapsulation** - The property of owning data
 2. **Inheritance** - The property of relationship hierarchy between classes
 3. **Polymorphism** - The property of implementaion or adaptation - classes can cutomize their own behaviour even when they are based on other classes

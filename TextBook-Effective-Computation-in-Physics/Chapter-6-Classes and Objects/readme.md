Classes - Organize data, methods and functions.

## Object Orientation

 A framework for classifying distinct concepts into comprehensible and digetible chunks.
 
 A framework for organization data, methods and functions peculiar to an entity, a model, an object
 
 Object Orientation is defined by the following properties
 
 1. Encapsulation - The property of owning data
 2. Inheritance - The property of relationship hierarchy between classes
 3. Polymorphism - The property of implementaion or adaptation - classes can cutomize their own behaviour even when they are based on other classes
